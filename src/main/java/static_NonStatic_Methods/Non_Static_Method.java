/**
ðŸ”¹ What is a Non-Static (Instance) Method?
A non-static method belongs to an object of a class â€” not to the class itself.
That means you must create an object to call it.

ðŸ§  Key Points
Declared without	static keyword
Belongs to	Each object (instance)
Accessed using	Object reference (e.g., obj.methodName())
Can access	Both static and non-static variables
Can use	this and super keywords
Memory allocation	Happens when an object is created
