/** Local Variables: A local variable in Java is a variable declared inside a method. Or Inside a constructor
    ********** Key Points *************
	Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.
	Must be initialized before use (Java doesnâ€™t assign default values).
	Scope is limited to the block in which it is declared.
	Memory is allocated when the method is called and released when it exits.
 **/

/***Explanation:
	 message(variable declared in the  dispayMessage method), a, b, and sum are local variables because they are declared inside methods.
	 They cannot be accessed outside their respective methods.
	 For example, trying to print message inside calculateSum() will cause a compile-time error.
